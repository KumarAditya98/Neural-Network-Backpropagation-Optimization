# Steps of code execution:
<ol>
  <li>Data Collection.py - This is done initially and stored seperately.
  <li>Preliminary_Backpropagation code is a starting point for everyone to get familiar with the code.
  <li>Generalization was developed later for LM, Batch and Generalization.
  <li>Conjugate gradient code was developed independently.
  <li>Final integration python file compiles everything.
  <li>Modeling python file is the final modeling part. 
</ol>

<p>Attemped code:</p>

  <li> Variable Learning rate.py</li>
