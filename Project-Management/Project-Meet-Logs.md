## Project Discussion (10/04/2023) - Meeting notes:

First meet for objective clarification, project scope clarification and expectation alignment. The following are the to-do's for each member of the group:- 

* Aditya Nayak -   
  * Dataset Collection - Requirement of 3 Datasets { Features < 5 (Small), 5 < Features < 15 (Medium), Features > 15 (Large) }
  * Selection Tasks - 1. Data Cleaning
                      2. Feature selection/Feature reduction using PCA/ EDA/ SVD/ Random Forest - For final features usable in model.
  * To implement - Variable Learning Rate, SGD with Momentum

* Aditya Kumar - 
  * Push already developed backpropagation code with SGD for 1-S-1 network to main branch for usability by other members.
  * Generalize backpropagation code with SGD for custom number of layers, custom transfer function, custom number of neurons for project progress.
  * To implement - Levenberg-Marqadt algorithm, Bayesian regularizaton, LM algorithm with momentum.

* Medhasweta Sen - 
  * Generalize backpropagation algorithm along with Aditya Kumar. 
  * To implement - Conjugate Gradient algorithm
